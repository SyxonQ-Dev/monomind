/**
 * doc-count generation — shared repo-root/tracked-file plumbing.
 * Split out of generate-doc-counts.mjs (file-size sweep). Pure move.
 *
 * What counts: tracked files, plus the skills generated at pack time.
 *
 * Walking the working tree made the counts machine-dependent: the monodesign
 * skill is gitignored and compiled locally (and by the CLI's prepack), so a
 * checkout that had compiled it said 90 bundled skills and one that had not
 * said 89; any untracked scratch file counted too. Now a file counts when git
 * tracks it or when it lies in a generated skill directory, which is compiled
 * fresh first — exactly what `npm pack` ships.
