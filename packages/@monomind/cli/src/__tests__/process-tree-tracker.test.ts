/**
 * Unit tests for `trackDescendants` (orgrt/process-tree.ts) — #359's
 * follow-up fix. A single point-in-time `groupClosure` snapshot cannot
 * reach a background job once its launching shell has already exited: the
 * real, installed Claude Code CLI spawns each Bash-tool shell call as the
 * leader of its OWN process group (live-verified during #359), and that
 * shell typically exits within milliseconds of backgrounding a job — by
 * the time a user hits Stop "minutes later", there is no live PPID edge
 * left to the shell, and its pgid was never recorded anywhere durable.
 * `trackDescendants` samples the tree every `intervalMs` for the turn's
 * lifetime specifically to catch that shell (and record its pgid) WHILE
 * it's still connected, so a later `signal()`/`liveMembers()` call can
 * still reach the orphaned job through that recorded pgid.
 *
 * Uses REAL short-lived processes — never `pkill -f`, only PIDs this test
 * itself discovered and recorded.
