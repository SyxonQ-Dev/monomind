/**
 * GrokAgentRunner — AgentRunner impl backed by the Grok Build CLI (`grok`,
 * xAI's agentic coding CLI: https://docs.x.ai/build/cli).
 *
 * Architectural pattern: SAME as CodexAgentRunner/AntigravityAgentRunner/
 * KimiCodeAgentRunner — spawn the vendor's CLI binary, parse its NDJSON
 * stream, normalize to AgentMessage. No SDK dependency.
 *
 * Auth: inherited from the CLI's own login flow (subscription/API key
 * managed by `grok` itself). No env vars set by this runner.
 *
 * Streaming / liveness — WHY INCREMENTAL (#204):
 *   This runner originally buffered ALL of grok's stdout until the
 *   subprocess exited before parsing anything, so any turn longer than
 *   session.ts's 4-minute silent-stream watchdog (SILENT_SESSION_MS) yielded
 *   zero messages in time — abort, retry, kill, circuit breaker. Same bug
 *   class the codex/kimi/antigravity runners had (#204 audit). This runner
 *   now parses stdout LINE BY LINE as data arrives: a liveness `tool_use`
 *   message is yielded the instant the subprocess spawns (deterministically
 *   winning the watchdog's first-pull race regardless of model latency), and
 *   each parsed assistant event is yielded as its line lands rather than
 *   accumulated until process exit. Unlike codex/agy, grok's guessed wire
 *   shapes (see below) carry no distinct "tool execution" event of their
 *   own — org tools only ever arrive via the ```tool_call fence protocol —
 *   so there is nothing else to forward as tool_use liveness besides the
 *   spawn-time yield. Fatal provider errors (auth/quota) are classified via
 *   the shared classifyStderr helper (same as kimi/codex/antigravity) and
 *   tagged non-retryable. The STARTUP_GRACE_MS first-run-prompt hang
 *   detection below is unrelated to #204 (it guards a different failure
 *   mode — a stuck interactive trust prompt, not a slow-but-alive turn) and
 *   is unchanged by this fix.
 *
 * Org tools (org_send, knowledge_search, ask_human, …) — FENCE PROTOCOL:
 *   Same approach as codex/kimi/opencode. Tools are rendered INTO the first
 *   prompt; the model emits ```tool_call fences; this runner parses them out
 *   of the assistant text, executes the real OrgToolDef handlers in-process
 *   (gated through canUseTool), and feeds results back as the next prompt.
 *
 * Subprocess protocol — per public docs (docs.x.ai/build/cli/reference),
 * PARTIALLY byte-verified against a live v1.0.5 install (`npm install -g
 * @xai-official/grok`; see #178). CONFIRMED LIVE: the flag was wrong — this
 * runner used to pass `--format json`, which grok rejects outright
 * ("unexpected argument '--format' found" — no such flag exists). Fixed to
 * `--output-format json`, confirmed correct by getting past argument
 * parsing straight to an auth error ("Not signed in") with no XAI_API_KEY
 * available to test further.
 *
 * STILL UNVERIFIED (no XAI_API_KEY in the environment this fix was made
 * in): grok's `--output-format` has FOUR documented values — `plain`,
 * `json`, `streaming-json` (NDJSON of native ACP session updates), and
 * `streaming-messages-json` (NDJSON in the Anthropic Messages API wire
 * format). This runner uses plain `json`, but events are parsed as
 * one-JSON-object-per-line (NDJSON) — worth checking live whether `json`
 * actually emits NDJSON, or a single (possibly multi-line-formatted) JSON
 * blob that would break the line-based parser. If it's the latter,
 * `streaming-messages-json` looks like the better fit (NDJSON, and a
 * documented wire format this codebase already knows how to parse
 * elsewhere) — untested, flagging rather than guessing. The exact NDJSON
 * event field names for whichever format is correct were STILL not
 * available at fix time, so event parsing tolerates several plausible
 * shapes (codex-style `item.type === 'agent_message'`, a flat `role:
 * 'assistant'` shape, and a flat `type: 'assistant'`/`'message'` shape)
 * rather than committing to one. Verify against a real XAI_API_KEY and
 * tighten this parser if the real shape differs — a wrong guess here fails
 * closed (no text extracted, not a crash), which is what the "no known
 * shape matched" path is for.
 *   - Invocation: `grok -p "<prompt>" --output-format json [--model X] [--cwd Y]
 *                 [--always-approve] [--sandbox workspace] [-r <sessionId> | -c]`
 *     (the sandbox profile follows the role's policy.git level — cli-sandbox.ts)
 *   - Session continuity: `-r/--resume [<id>]` resumes a specific session,
 *     `-c/--continue` resumes the most recent one. Session id is captured
 *     from any event carrying `session_id` / `sessionId` / `thread_id`.
 *   - stderr is human diagnostics; buffered and surfaced on non-zero exit.
 *
 * File-size sweep: the NDJSON event extractors + batch parser live in
 * grok-runner-parse.ts, and the subprocess turn runner (streamTurn) and
 * turn-error builder (turnError) live in grok-runner-stream.ts — both
 * re-exported below where other modules import them from here.
