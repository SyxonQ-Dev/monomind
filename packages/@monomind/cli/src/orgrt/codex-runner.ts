/**
 * CodexAgentRunner — AgentRunner impl backed by the Codex CLI (subprocess).
 *
 * Architectural pattern: SAME as KimiCodeAgentRunner/AntigravityAgentRunner —
 * spawn the vendor's CLI binary, parse its JSONL stream, normalize to
 * AgentMessage. No SDK dependency (the @openai/codex-sdk package would add
 * ~100MB; we use the CLI directly like we do for kimi).
 *
 * Auth: inherited from ~/.codex/auth.json (created by `codex login`). The
 * ChatGPT subscription flows through this credential cache. No env vars.
 *
 * Streaming / liveness — WHY INCREMENTAL (#204):
 *   This runner originally buffered ALL of stdout until the codex subprocess
 *   exited, then parsed the whole batch. session.ts races the FIRST pull from
 *   this runner against a 4-minute silent-stream watchdog (SILENT_SESSION_MS),
 *   so any turn longer than 4 minutes yielded zero messages in time — abort,
 *   retry, kill, circuit breaker, stalled org. Same bug class as the
 *   kimi/antigravity runners had (#204 audit). This runner now parses stdout
 *   LINE BY LINE as data arrives: a liveness `tool_use` message is yielded
 *   the moment the subprocess spawns (deterministically winning the
 *   first-pull race regardless of model-thinking latency), assistant text is
 *   yielded as each `agent_message` item lands (codex sends whole items, not
 *   per-token deltas — no accumulation needed, unlike agy), and codex's own
 *   `command_execution` items are forwarded as `tool_use` liveness messages
 *   at their `item.started` boundary. Tool_call fences are still collected
 *   from the raw texts and parsed at end of turn (fence parsing needs the
 *   complete text).
 *
 * Org tools (org_send, knowledge_search, ask_human, …) — FENCE PROTOCOL:
 *   Same approach as kimi/opencode/antigravity. Tools are rendered INTO the
 *   first prompt; the model emits ```tool_call fences; this runner parses
 *   them out of the agent_message text, executes the real OrgToolDef handlers
 *   in-process (gated through canUseTool), and feeds results back as the
 *   next prompt.
 *
 * Subprocess protocol — REWRITTEN against openai/codex's own Rust source
 * (issue #178). This runner previously assumed a "thread.started" /
 * "item.completed" event shape sourced from `openai/codex/sdk/typescript`,
 * which turned out to be a DIFFERENT wire format than what `codex exec
 * --json` actually emits. Confirmed two ways: (1) live output from an
 * installed codex v0.21.0 (`brew install codex`) showed events shaped like
 * `{"id":"1","msg":{"type":"task_started"}}` — nothing resembling
 * "thread.started"; (2) cross-checked against
 * `codex-rs/protocol/src/protocol.rs`'s `EventMsg` enum
 * (`#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]`) and
 * `codex-rs/protocol/src/legacy_events.rs`, which is EXACTLY this wire
 * format and is explicitly comment-labeled "v1 wire format" (still the
 * live default for `--json`, not a deprecated relic).
 *
 *   - Invocation: `codex exec --json [--model X] [--cd Y]
 *                 [--skip-git-repo-check] [--sandbox <mode>]
 *                 [resume <sessionId>] -- -` with the prompt on STDIN
 *     (the sandbox mode follows the role's policy.git level — cli-sandbox.ts)
 *     (see streamTurn for why argv is not used). `--experimental-json`
 *     (the old flag name) doesn't exist in v0.21.0 — confirmed live
 *     ("unexpected argument '--experimental-json' found"); `--json` is
 *     correct in both v0.21.0 and the current v0.147.0 (where
 *     `--experimental-json` IS an alias again, per current
 *     `codex-rs/exec/src/cli.rs` — but v0.21.0 predates that alias).
 *   - `resume` is a SUBCOMMAND of `exec`, not a positional after other exec
 *     flags in isolation — `codex exec resume <sessionId> ["<prompt>"]`,
 *     with `exec`'s own global flags (--json, --model, --sandbox, etc.)
 *     specified BEFORE the `resume` token. Confirmed live (v0.147.0 AND
 *     v0.149.0) that this exact arg order parses cleanly. v0.21.0 has no
 *     `resume` subcommand at all (confirmed live: "resume" was consumed as
 *     the PROMPT text itself, then the actual session id was rejected as an
 *     unexpected extra positional) — so resume silently can't work
 *     pre-~v0.12x. This runner doesn't detect codex's version; if resume
 *     fails on an old install, each turn falls back to a fresh (contextless)
 *     session rather than erroring — a real limitation, not fixed here.
 *   - JSONL on stdout, one event per line. Confirmed real EventMsg variants
 *     (source: `EventMsg` enum + each variant's struct, all in
 *     `protocol.rs`):
 *       {"type":"session_configured","session_id":"...","thread_id":"...",
 *        "model":"...",...}                            — session/thread id
 *       {"type":"task_started"}                          — turn started
 *       {"type":"agent_message","message":"...","phase":...}
 *                                                         — assistant text
 *       {"type":"token_count","info":{"last_token_usage":
 *        {"input_tokens":N,"output_tokens":N,"reasoning_output_tokens":N,
 *         "total_tokens":N,...},"total_token_usage":{...}},...}
 *                       — `last_token_usage` is per-TURN (not cumulative);
 *                         `total_token_usage` IS cumulative — use the former
 *       {"type":"task_complete","turn_id":"...",
 *        "last_agent_message":"...","error":{"message":"..."}|absent,...}
 *       {"type":"error","message":"...",...}
 *   - NO per-token streaming in this event set (whole agent_message events
 *     only, unlike the discarded thread/item assumption).
 *   - Session ID: captured from `session_configured.session_id` (or
 *     `.thread_id` — both present, same value in observed live output),
 *     NOT from a "thread.started" event, which doesn't exist in THIS
 *     (legacy) protocol variant — see the CURRENT shape below, where it does.
 *   - stderr is human diagnostics; buffer and surface on non-zero exit only.
 *
 * WIRE-FORMAT UPDATE (#178 follow-up, #204) — live-verified 2026-08-22
 * against an authenticated codex v0.149.0 (`codex login status` →
 * "Logged in using ChatGPT"), three real `codex exec --json` invocations:
 *
 *   1. Plain turn (`"reply with exactly the word: pong"`):
 *      {"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"01a02a2f-...-...-...-..."}
 *      {"type":"turn.started"}
 *      {"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_0","type":"agent_message","text":"pong"}}
 *      {"type":"turn.completed","usage":{"input_tokens":13085,"cached_input_tokens":9984,
 *       "cache_write_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":5,"reasoning_output_tokens":0}}
 *   2. Turn with a shell tool call (`"run: echo hello-from-codex-shell"`) — adds:
 *      {"type":"item.started","item":{"id":"item_1","type":"command_execution",
 *       "command":"...","aggregated_output":"","exit_code":null,"status":"in_progress"}}
 *      {"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_1","type":"command_execution",
 *       "command":"...","aggregated_output":"hello-from-codex-shell\n","exit_code":0,
 *       "status":"completed"}}
 *   3. `codex exec resume <threadId> "..."` × 3 in the same thread — confirms
 *      (a) `resume` still works exactly as documented above, (b)
 *      `turn.completed.usage.input_tokens` stays roughly flat across resumed
 *      turns (13097 → 13112) rather than growing cumulatively, consistent
 *      with per-turn (not cumulative) usage — same inference as legacy
 *      `token_count.info.last_token_usage` vs `total_token_usage`, though
 *      this wasn't cross-checked against Rust source (no `codex-rs` checkout
 *      in this environment) the way the legacy shape originally was.
 *
 * NONE of `session_configured` / `task_started` / `agent_message` (top-level)
 * / `token_count` / `task_complete` — the shape this runner was originally
 * written against — appeared in ANY of the above. This runner was silently
 * broken against any codex install emitting the current shape: every switch
 * branch missed, so assistant text/inputTokens/outputTokens/threadId all
 * stayed at their zero-values for every single turn, producing no assistant
 * text, no token accounting, and no session resumption — while `exitCode`
 * was still 0, so nothing surfaced as an error either.
 *
 * Both shapes are now parsed (see CURRENT vs LEGACY branches in
 * `handleEvent` below). The legacy shape is kept because there's no live
 * evidence it was ever wrong for the v0.147.0 install it was verified
 * against — only that a newer install (v0.149.0) has since moved to the
 * item-based shape. Error/failure item types (e.g. a possible
 * `turn.failed`) were NOT observed live and are not guessed at here — an
 * error turn was only ever seen as a non-zero exit with a plain-text stderr
 * message (e.g. `resume`ing an unknown thread id → exit 1, no JSON on
 * stdout at all), which the existing `outcome.exitCode !== 0` handling
 * already covers unchanged.
