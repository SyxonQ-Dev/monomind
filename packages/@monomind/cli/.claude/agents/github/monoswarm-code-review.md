# Code Review Swarm - Automated Code Review with AI Agents

## Overview

Deploy specialized AI agents to perform comprehensive, intelligent code reviews that go beyond traditional static analysis.

The swarm is made of parallel subagents (the Task tool), each owning one review lens. GitHub work goes through the `gh` CLI; local analysis uses the real `monomind analyze` and `monomind security` commands and the monograph MCP tools. There is no monomind command that reviews a PR on its own — the agents do the reviewing.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Review System

```bash
# Gather PR context once and share it with every reviewer
PR=123
gh pr view $PR --json number,title,body,files,additions,deletions,labels,headRefOid,baseRefName > /tmp/pr-$PR.json
gh pr diff $PR --color never > /tmp/pr-$PR.diff
gh pr diff $PR --name-only > /tmp/pr-$PR.files

# Check out the PR locally so the analyzers see the real code
gh pr checkout $PR

# Risk, change type and suggested reviewers for the PR's range
BASE=$(jq -r .baseRefName /tmp/pr-$PR.json)
npx monomind analyze diff "origin/$BASE..HEAD" --risk --classify --reviewers

# Post initial review status
gh pr comment $PR --body "🔍 Multi-agent code review started (security, performance, architecture, style)"
```

Then spawn one reviewer subagent per lens in a single message (for example `Security Engineer`, `reviewer` focused on performance, `system-architect`, `reviewer` focused on style), each given the PR number, `/tmp/pr-$PR.diff` and the file list, and each told to return findings as JSON (`path`, `line`, `severity`, `body`).

### 2. Specialized Review Agents

#### Security Agent

```bash
# Security-focused review with gh CLI
CHANGED_FILES=$(gh pr diff 123 --name-only)

# Real scanners: hardcoded secrets and code/dependency issues
npx monomind security secrets -p . --depth deep
npx monomind security scan -t . --type all -o json > /tmp/security-123.txt   # banner, then the JSON report

# The security subagent reads the diff and scanner output and writes its findings
SECURITY_RESULTS=$(cat /tmp/security-findings-123.md)

# Post security findings
if grep -q "critical" /tmp/security-findings-123.md; then
  # Request changes for critical issues
  gh pr review 123 --request-changes --body "$SECURITY_RESULTS"
  # Add security label
  gh pr edit 123 --add-label "security-review-required"
else
  # Post as comment for non-critical issues
  gh pr comment 123 --body "$SECURITY_RESULTS"
fi
```

#### Performance Agent

```bash
# Complexity hot spots (then keep only the files the PR changed)
npx monomind analyze complexity src/ --threshold 15 --format json > /tmp/complexity-123.json
gh pr diff 123 --name-only

# Compare benchmarks against the base branch using the project's own benchmark script
git checkout origin/main && npm run bench > /tmp/bench-base.txt
gh pr checkout 123 && npm run bench > /tmp/bench-pr.txt
diff /tmp/bench-base.txt /tmp/bench-pr.txt
```

#### Architecture Agent

Use the monograph MCP tools to see what a changed symbol touches:

```bash
# Rebuild the graph for the checked-out PR, then query it
npx monomind monograph build

# In the agent: blast radius and neighbours of each changed symbol
mcp__monomind__monograph_impact { name: "ChangedFunction" }
mcp__monomind__monograph_neighbors { name: "ChangedClass" }

# Import coupling of the changed area
npx monomind analyze imports src/
```

### 3. Review Configuration

```yaml
# .github/review-swarm.yml — read by the coordinating agent, not by a CLI
version: 1
review:
  auto-trigger: true
  required-agents:
    - security
    - performance
    - style
  optional-agents:
    - architecture
    - accessibility
    - i18n

  thresholds:
    security: block
    performance: warn
    style: suggest

  rules:
    security:
      - no-eval
      - no-hardcoded-secrets
      - proper-auth-checks
    performance:
      - no-n-plus-one
      - efficient-queries
      - proper-caching
    architecture:
      - max-coupling: 5
      - min-cohesion: 0.7
      - follow-patterns
```

## Review Agents

### Security Review Agent

## Advanced Review Features

### 1. Context-Aware Reviews

```bash
# Linked issues and earlier PRs that touched the same files
gh pr view 123 --json closingIssuesReferences --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'
for f in $(gh pr diff 123 --name-only); do
  gh pr list --state merged --search "$f" --limit 5 --json number,title
done

# Breaking-change hints: changed exported symbols and who depends on them
npx monomind analyze diff origin/main..HEAD --classify --verbose
```

### 2. Learning from History

```bash
# Pull past review comments to calibrate what this repo cares about
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments?per_page=100" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | {path, body}' > /tmp/past-review-comments.json

# Keep recurring patterns for future reviews
npx monomind memory store -k "review/patterns/$(date +%Y-%m)" \
  --value "$(jq -r '.body' /tmp/past-review-comments.json | head -200)" -n reviews
npx monomind memory search -q "review patterns auth" -n reviews
```

### 3. Cross-PR Analysis

```bash
# Review related PRs together: overlapping files are integration risks
for pr in 123 124 125; do
  gh pr diff $pr --name-only | sed "s/^/$pr /"
done | sort -k2 | awk '{print $2}' | uniq -d
```

## Review Automation

### Auto-Review on Push

The workflow gathers context and runs the real analyzers; the multi-agent review itself runs in Claude Code (locally or via a Claude Code GitHub Action), not as a CLI step.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/auto-review.yml
name: Automated Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review-context:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Analyze change risk
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          PR_NUM=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          BASE=${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
          REPORT=$(npx -y monomind analyze diff "origin/$BASE..HEAD" --risk --classify)
          SECRETS=$(npx -y monomind security secrets -p . --depth standard)

          gh pr comment $PR_NUM --body "$(printf '## Automated review context\n\n```\n%s\n```\n\n```\n%s\n```' "$REPORT" "$SECRETS")"
```

### Review Triggers

```javascript
// Custom review triggers — which reviewer subagents to spawn for which paths
{
  "triggers": {
    "high-risk-files": {
      "paths": ["**/auth/**", "**/payment/**"],
      "agents": ["security", "architecture"],
      "depth": "comprehensive"
    },
    "performance-critical": {
      "paths": ["**/api/**", "**/database/**"],
      "agents": ["performance", "database"],
      "benchmarks": true
    },
    "ui-changes": {
      "paths": ["**/components/**", "**/styles/**"],
      "agents": ["accessibility", "style", "i18n"],
      "visual-tests": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Review Comments

### Intelligent Comment Generation

```bash
# Reviewer subagents return findings as JSON:
# [{ "path": "src/auth.ts", "line": 42, "body": "..." }, ...]
PR=123
COMMIT=$(gh pr view $PR --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)

# Post all inline comments as a single review
jq -n --arg commit "$COMMIT" --slurpfile c /tmp/findings-$PR.json '{
  commit_id: $commit,
  event: "COMMENT",
  body: "Multi-agent review findings",
  comments: ($c[0] | map({path, line, side: "RIGHT", body}))
}' | gh api --method POST "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$PR/reviews" --input -
```

### Comment Templates

````markdown
<!-- Security Issue Template -->

🔒 **Security Issue: [Type]**

**Severity**: 🔴 Critical / 🟡 High / 🟢 Low

**Description**:
[Clear explanation of the security issue]

**Impact**:
[Potential consequences if not addressed]

**Suggested Fix**:

```language
[Code example of the fix]
```

**References**:

- [OWASP Guide](link)
- [Security Best Practices](link)
````

### Batch Comment Management

```bash
# List review threads with their resolution state
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $pr:Int!) {
    repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
      pullRequest(number:$pr) {
        reviewThreads(first:100) { nodes { id isResolved isOutdated path } }
      }
    }
  }' -f owner=OWNER -f repo=REPO -F pr=123

# Resolve an outdated thread
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){ resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){ thread { isResolved } } }' -f id=THREAD_ID
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### Status Checks

```bash
# Make the review workflow's job a required check on main
gh api --method PUT "repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection" --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "required_status_checks": { "strict": true, "contexts": ["review-context"] },
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": { "required_approving_review_count": 1 },
  "restrictions": null
}
EOF

# See where a PR stands
gh pr checks 123
```

### Quality Gates

Quality gates are enforced by the coordinating agent before it approves: no critical security findings, no benchmark regression over 5%, coverage at or above the project minimum, and no function above the complexity threshold (`npx monomind analyze complexity src/ --threshold 10`).

### Review Metrics

```bash
# Review activity for the last 30 days
SINCE=$(date -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d)
gh pr list --state merged --search "merged:>=$SINCE" --json number,reviews,additions,deletions \
  --jq 'map({number, reviews: (.reviews | length), size: (.additions + .deletions)})'
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Review Configuration

- Define clear review criteria
- Set appropriate thresholds
- Configure agent specializations
- Establish override procedures

### 2. Comment Quality

- Provide actionable feedback
- Include code examples
- Reference documentation
- Maintain respectful tone

### 3. Performance

- Cache analysis results
- Incremental reviews for large PRs
- Parallel agent execution
- Smart comment batching (one review with many inline comments, not many reviews)

## Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Review Agents

```javascript
// Create custom review agent
class CustomReviewAgent {
  async review(pr) {
    const issues = [];

    // Custom logic here
    if (await this.checkCustomRule(pr)) {
      issues.push({
        severity: "warning",
        message: "Custom rule violation",
        suggestion: "Fix suggestion",
      });
    }

    return issues;
  }
}
```

### 2. Review Orchestration

Order reviewers by risk: run `npx monomind analyze diff --risk` first, spawn the security and architecture reviewers for high-risk files, and give low-risk files (docs, tests, formatting) a single style pass.

## Examples

### Security-Critical PR

```bash
# Auth system changes
gh pr checkout 456
npx monomind security scan -t . --depth deep
npx monomind security secrets --depth deep
# Spawn: Security Engineer + reviewer (auth flows) + reviewer (audit logging)
gh pr edit 456 --add-label "security-review-required"
```

### Performance-Sensitive PR

```bash
# Database optimization
gh pr checkout 789
npx monomind analyze complexity src/ --threshold 15
# Spawn: Database Optimizer + Performance Benchmarker; compare benchmarks against main
```

### UI Component PR

```bash
# New component library
gh pr checkout 321
# Spawn: Accessibility Auditor + Monodesign + Technical Writer (docs)
gh pr diff 321 --name-only | grep -E '\.(tsx|jsx|vue|css)$'
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Review Reports

```bash
# Markdown summary of open PRs waiting on review
gh pr list --search "review:required" --json number,title,author,createdAt \
  --jq '.[] | "- #\(.number) \(.title) (@\(.author.login), opened \(.createdAt[:10]))"'
```
