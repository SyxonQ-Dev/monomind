/**
 * Cleanly terminate a Chrome/Chromium instance we launched on `port`.
 * Sends the `Browser.close` CDP command (the correct graceful shutdown —
 * closes all tabs and exits the process cleanly) over `client`'s connection.
 * If that command fails, times out, or the connection is already gone,
 * falls back to killing the tracked PID directly so a headed/interactive
 * browser window (e.g. one spawned for a login/CAPTCHA flow) never lingers
 * as a visible, authenticated, still-debuggable orphan process.
 *
 * On the graceful path this resolves only once the process is actually gone,
 * or after force-killing it when it outlasts PROCESS_EXIT_TIMEOUT_MS. Chrome
 * acknowledges `Browser.close` well before it exits, and this used to return
 * on the ack with an unref'd 1s timer as the only force-kill — so it resolved
 * while Chrome was still running and holding its port and its profile's
 * singleton lock, and if the caller's process exited first the kill never
 * happened at all. Callers reasonably read a resolved close() as "that
 * browser is gone"; on the graceful path it now means that.

/**
 * Give back the CDP port of a browser we launched that nothing is using any

 * the command that spawned it and later commands can reattach — but nothing
 * reaped it afterwards, so an abandoned session kept listening on its port
 * (9222 by convention, which other local tools want) indefinitely. A foreign
 * CDP server *answers* there rather than refusing the connection, so those
 * tools retry the wrong port and report misleading errors instead of moving on.
 *
 * Nothing long-lived exists to run this on a timer — every CLI command is its
 * own short-lived process — so it runs at the next launch/attach instead
 * (see launchBrowser). A browser is reaped only when ALL of these hold:
 *   - the persisted session says WE launched it — `connect` records
 *     launched:false for a browser that belongs to the user, never touched;
 *   - that session is older than IDLE_REAP_AFTER_MS;
 *   - the CDP endpoint still answers and reports ZERO targets. An open tab,
 *     or a client attached to one (Chrome drops webSocketDebuggerUrl from an
 *     attached target but still lists it), means the session is live and
 *     reattach-across-commands must keep working.
 *
 * Shutdown goes through closeBrowser() on the browser-level websocket — the
 * only connection left once every target is gone — so a recycled PID can
 * never be signaled by mistake: graceful `Browser.close` reaches whatever is
 * actually listening on that port, at any age, and the persisted PID is only
 * ever used for closeBrowser's own age-bounded force-kill.
 *
 * Never throws: a failed reap must not stop a launch. Returns the reaped
 * port, or null when there was nothing to reap. Sessions are per-port
 * (#318), so every recorded one is considered, not just the newest.
